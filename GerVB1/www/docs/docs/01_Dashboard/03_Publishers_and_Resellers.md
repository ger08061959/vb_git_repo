The following documentation only applies to users belonging to a **reseller** type organisation.

A reseller within this system is able to create any number of **resellers** and **publishers** in an hierarchical manner. Each with their own set of **users** and **videos**.

A reseller is an administrator of its publishers and the videos of those publishers. A publisher can only manage its own users and videos. Please note that a reseller has no videos of its own; for this purpose, a reseller always needs to create at least one publisher in order to get started.

Do take note that a reseller can not be changed to a publisher, or vice versa.
