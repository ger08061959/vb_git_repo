## Users ##
A user that is part of a reseller or is a manager of a publisher, can create new user accounts. Always make sure to add the user to a correct organisation and set the correct roles if the organisation is of a publisher type.

It is adviced to not remove users, but rather to set them to `Inactive`. Use the edit function to set the `Active` value to `Inactive`.

### Profile ###
Every user can change their profile. This can be done via the edit profile button on dashboard page or via the profile in the upper-right of the menu.
The password can be changed if the fields password and confirm password are both filled in correctly.

### Roles and Permissions ###
Please refer to the dedicated page for more info on [roles and permissions](/docs/Dashboard/Roles_and_Permissions).
