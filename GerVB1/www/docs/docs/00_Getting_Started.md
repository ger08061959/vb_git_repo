## Publishers and Resellers ##

An organisation can be one of two types: (1) Reseller or (2) Publisher. A reseller acts as an administrator and can make resellers and publishers. Furthermore, a reseller can manage publishers and their videos. However, a reseller holds no videos; these are stored per publisher. A publisher is only able to manage and upload videos.

For more information, refer to the dedicated [Publishers and Resellers](/docs/Dashboard/Publishers_and_Resellers) page.
